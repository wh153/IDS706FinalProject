[![CI/CD](https://github.com/wh153/IDS706FinalProject/actions/workflows/CI&CD.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wh153/IDS706FinalProject/actions/workflows/CI&CD.yml)

The project aimed to take advantage of the cloud technologies and platforms to build a data engineering pipeline for predicting stock prices. Three major parts consist of the main workflow: 1. Retrieving and Storing the Data, 2. Building Prediction Model, 3. Front-end with Dash and Docker Container.

## 1. Retrieving and Storing the Data
In the project, real-time data is adopted. We take Apple as an example. The data is from the Polygon API (https://polygon.io/).
