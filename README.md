# Real Time Apple Stock Price Prediction Dash Web Application 
[![CI/CD](https://github.com/wh153/IDS706FinalProject/actions/workflows/CI&CD.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wh153/IDS706FinalProject/actions/workflows/CI&CD.yml)

The project aimed to take advantage of the cloud technologies and platforms to build a data engineering pipeline for predicting stock prices. Three major parts consist of the main workflow: 1. Retrieving and Storing the Data, 2. Building Prediction Model, 3. Front-end with Dash and Docker Container.

The overall workflow is as follows:

## 1. Retrieving and Storing the Data
In the project, real-time data is adopted. We take Apple as an example. The data is from the Polygon API (https://polygon.io/). The API is called with RESTful architectural style.

A lambda function triggered by a Cloud-Watch is built for retrieving data every minute using RESTful API. The  Cloud-Watch Log is used for holding the logging information. Then, the retrieved data is stored in a Dynamo DB that is also done by the lambda function.

## 2. Building Prediction Model
Stock predicting is a time-series regression problem. Facebook Prophet model is adopted in the project. It achieves a better result than the AR model, the MA model, and the ARIMA model. The Prophet model is also robust to the shifting trends. The model runs fast and is fully automated. It is also easy to fine-tune the model. So, it fits well in the philosophy of cloud computing.

## 3. Front-end with Dash and Docker Container
The result is visualized by an interactive plot with Dash. By clicking the "predict" button, new data is retrieved and the model is updated. Then, the new plot is shown in the front-end.

Docker is used for encapsulation. Our application is contained by Docker and held by EC2.
